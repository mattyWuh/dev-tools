# dev-tools

Some bash scripts to automate the setup of a new environment. Current functionality is for `linux` only. 

## Reasoning
**Docker** : For launching containers. Containers are great.

**Nerd Font** : A nice monospaced font with ligatures.

**Hyper** : A fun terminal to work in with lots of packages and customization options.

**Node/npm** : Here to enable gitmojis.

**Python** : Aside from being the second-best language for any task, it also happens to be home to cookiecutter, which can be used for any language.

**Starship** : A customizable shell prompt written in `rust`.

**Zsh** : Slightly less archaic than `bash` and has wide support. 

## Future
Add CI testing. 

Add support for other 'nix operating systems.
